# NESTED CLASSES
## Definition of Nested Classes
- A **nested class** is a **class defined within another class**. 
- The nested class behaves similarly to any other class, but **its scope is limited to the enclosing class**. 
- The enclosing class can access private members of the nested class, but the nested class doesn't have access to the enclosing class's private members by default (unless specific access is granted).

## Why Use Nested Classes?
Nested classes can be useful in **situations where a class is conceptually part of another class but doesn't need to be visible outside** of it. Some common reasons to use nested classes:
- **Encapsulation**: Keep related classes together without exposing internal implementation details.
- **Organizational purposes**: It makes sense to group certain classes together logically.
- **Hierarchical representation**: Sometimes, one class is tightly coupled with another class, and it's only useful within that context.

## Example of a Nested Class
**Outer.hpp**
```C++
#ifndef OUTER_HPP
#define OUTER_HPP

#include <iostream>

class Outer {
private:
    int outerData;

public:
    // Constructor for Outer class
    Outer(int outerValue);

    // A method of Outer class
    void showOuterData();

    // Nested class inside Outer class
    class Inner {
    private:
        int innerData;

    public:
        // Constructor for Inner class
        Inner(int innerValue);

        // A method of Inner class
        void showInnerData();
    };
};

#endif // OUTER_HPP
```

**Outer.cpp**
```C++
#include "Outer.hpp"

// Definition of Outer class constructor
Outer::Outer(int outerValue) : outerData(outerValue) {}

// Definition of Outer class method
void Outer::showOuterData() {
    std::cout << "Outer data: " << outerData << std::endl;
}

/***************************************************************/

// Definition of Inner class constructor
Outer::Inner::Inner(int innerValue) : innerData(innerValue) {}

// Definition of Inner class method
void Outer::Inner::showInnerData() {
    std::cout << "Inner data: " << innerData << std::endl;
}
```

**main.cpp**
```C++
#include "Outer.hpp"

int main() {
    // Creating an object of Outer class
    Outer outerObj(100);
    outerObj.showOuterData();

    // Creating an object of the nested Inner class
    Outer::Inner innerObj(50);
    innerObj.showInnerData();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example
**Outer Class**
- The Outer class has a private member outerData and a public method showOuterData() to print its value.
- The constructor Outer(int value) initializes the outerData.

**Inner Class**
- The Inner class is defined within the scope of the Outer class. It also has a private member innerData and a public method showInnerData() to print its value.
- The constructor Inner(int value) initializes the innerData.
- The Inner class is publicly accessible but only within the context of the Outer class. Outside the Outer class, you can refer to it using Outer::Inner.

**Main**
- An instance of Outer, outerObj, is created with the value 100, and its method showOuterData() is called.
- An instance of the nested Inner class, innerObj, is created using Outer::Inner with the value 50, and its method showInnerData() is called.

## Key Points to Remember
- The nested class is defined inside another class, but you still create objects of the nested class in the usual way, except that you qualify it with the enclosing class's name (e.g., Outer::Inner).
- The nested class doesn't have automatic access to the enclosing class's members. You would need to pass the outer classâ€™s member to the inner class if needed.


## Use Cases of Nested Classes
- **Helper Classes**: When you need a class that is used solely by the enclosing class, like a utility or helpe
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details within the outer class, keeping internal workings private.

## Accessing Members of the Enclosing Class
By default, a nested class doesn't have access to the members (including private and protected) of its enclosing class. However, the enclosing class can access all members of the nested class, even the private ones. If you want the nested class to access the members of the enclosing class, you need to explicitly pass them or use friend declarations.

**Example of Passing the Enclosing Class Members**
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Outer {
private:
    int outerData;

public:
    Outer(int value) : outerData(value) {}

    // A method to return the outerData for the inner class
    int getOuterData() {
        return outerData;
    }

    class Inner {
    public:
        // Method that uses outer class data by accepting a reference
        void showOuterData(Outer &outer) {
            std::cout << "Accessing outer data from Inner: " << outer.getOuterData() << std::endl;
        }
    };
};

int main() {
    Outer outerObj(100);
    Outer::Inner innerObj;

    // Passing outer object to Inner's method
    innerObj.showOuterData(outerObj);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the nested class Inner doesn't have direct access to the private members of the enclosing class Outer, but it can access them by passing an Outer object and using a getter method (getOuterData()).

## Friend Declarations
You can use the friend declaration to allow the nested class to access the private or protected members of the enclosing class.

**Example using Friend Declarations**
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Outer {
private:
    int outerData;

public:
    Outer(int value) : outerData(value) {}

    // Making the Inner class a friend of Outer
    friend class Inner;

    class Inner {
    public:
        // Now Inner has direct access to outerData
        void showOuterData(Outer &outer) {
            std::cout << "Outer data accessed by Inner: " << outer.outerData << std::endl;
        }
    };
};

int main() {
    Outer outerObj(100);
    Outer::Inner innerObj;

    innerObj.showOuterData(outerObj);

    return 0;
}
```
In this case, Inner is declared as a friend of Outer, which means it can directly access Outer's private members, like outerData

## Static Nested Classes
A nested class can also be declared static. This means the nested class doesn't need an instance of the enclosing class to be instantiated, and it cannot access non-static members of the enclosing class.

**Example of a Static Nested Class**
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Outer {
public:
    // Static nested class
    class Inner {
    public:
        void showMessage() {
            std::cout << "This is a static nested class!" << std::endl;
        }
    };
};

int main() {
    // We can create an object of Inner class without an instance of Outer
    Outer::Inner innerObj;
    innerObj.showMessage();

    return 0;
}
```
Here, Inner is a static nested class, meaning it's independent of Outer. You don't need an instance of Outer to create an instance of Inner.

## Protected and Private Nested Classes
Just like regular members of a class, nested classes can be declared private or protected. When declared as such, their access is restricted to the scope of the outer class (or derived classes, in the case of protected).

**Example of Private Nested Class**
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Outer {
private:
    // Private nested class
    class Inner {
    public:
        void showMessage() {
            std::cout << "This is a private nested class!" << std::endl;
        }
    };

public:
    // Outer class method that uses the private nested class
    void accessInner() {
        Inner innerObj;
        innerObj.showMessage();
    }
};



int main() {
    Outer outerObj;
    outerObj.accessInner();

    // The following line will cause an error because Inner is private
    // Outer::Inner innerObj; // Not allowed

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the Inner class is private, so it can only be accessed within the Outer class. You cannot create an instance of Inner from outside Outer.

## Inheritance and Nested Classes
A nested class can also be involved in inheritance hierarchies. You can inherit nested classes and extend their functionality, just as you would with regular classes.
```C++
#include <iostream>

class Outer 
{
    public:
        class Inner 
        {
            public:
                void showMessage() {
                    std::cout << "Message from Inner class!" << std::endl;
                }
        };
};

// Derived class that inherits the Inner class from Outer
class DerivedInner : public Outer::Inner 
{
    public:
        void showDerivedMessage() {
            std::cout << "Message from DerivedInner class!" << std::endl;
        }
};

int main() {
    DerivedInner derivedObj;
    derivedObj.showMessage();       // Calls Inner class method
    derivedObj.showDerivedMessage(); // Calls DerivedInner class method

    return 0;
}
```
Here, DerivedInner inherits from the nested Inner class of Outer, allowing you to extend the functionality of the nested class through inheritance.
